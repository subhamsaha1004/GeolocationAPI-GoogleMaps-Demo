GeolocationAPI-GoogleMaps-Demo
==============================

This is a simple demo involving google maps and the html5 geolocation API. The geolocation API is a nice addtion to html5 which has a potential for supporting really nice personalised location based apps that when integrated with other features can produce really powerful experiences for the users. This example just explores the API and uses google maps for a simple use case. And it is also responsive.
